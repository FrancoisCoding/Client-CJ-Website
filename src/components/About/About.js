              First off, it goes by a lot of different terms. You’ve probably
              heard it referred to as, “Private Money,” “Equity-Based
              Financing,” “Bridge Financing,” or “Creative Financing,” and for
              the most part, they all mean the same thing.

              CJ Borden is the founder and owner of Quadruple J. Capital LLC, a
              private money lender based out of Hawaii that funds non-homeowner
              occupied single family properties and commercial properties. My
              team and I help real estate investors, real estate brokers and
              agents qualify for capital using a non-traditional financing that
              relies on the property’s merits, rather than your personal
              qualifications. These types of loans are often secured by a note
              and deed of trust in first lien position on the property. So, if
              you have a great deal, Quadruple J. Capital wants to be your
              funding source!

              The number one rule is: it’s much easier to shop for cash when you
              have a deal in hand and under contract. Why? Because a property
              that is not under contract is up for grabs by anyone and everyone
              and no lender, I repeat no lender will put in significant time,
              energy and resources on a property that can be taken out from
              beneath the borrower at any time or at any moment. So, to prevent
              losing the selling of a property, use the following step process:
            </p>
            <div className="qualified-text-list">
              <ul className="about-list">
                <li>Prospect and Review Potential Properties</li>
                <li>Write and Negotiate Offers</li>
                <li>Get Offer Accepted by Seller</li>
                <li>Put Earnest Money in Escrow to Complete the Contract</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              Once you have completed the four steps above, along with a
              fulfilled Purchase and Sale Agreement, and the property is under
              contract, you will be ready to shop for cash and fill out our loan
              application. <strong>CALL (877) 799-7575 AND APPLY NOW!</strong>

        <p className="why-text">
          It’s cheaper for an investor to get a loan from a Hard Money Lender at
          16% than it is to get a loan for 3, 4, 5, or 6% from the bank. Why?
          Because if the deal is good with a high % return on investment, the
          investor just needs to get the money. The following are other reasons
          why:

            <h2 className="why-card-header">It’s Fast</h2>
            <p className="why-card-text">
              Flipping homes is a time-sensitive business. Depending on how fast
              you submit the loan package items, you can have your loan in
              several days to several weeks. It can take one to three months to
              secure a loan with traditional financing.

            <h2 className="why-card-header">It Looks at Collateral, Not You</h2>
            <p className="why-card-text">
              Hard money lenders are not interested in credit score. They are
              interested in how much value they see in the property since the
              property is the asset that is backing the loan.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="why-card">
            <h2 className="why-card-header">It’s Everywhere</h2>
            <p className="why-card-text">
              Hard money lenders are often people who have funds parked in
              lower-yielding financial vehicles like CDs, stocks, or IRAs and
              are looking for newer ways to maximize their funds in higher
              yielding conduits, like lending on real estate.

          </div>
          <div className="why-card">
            <h2 className="why-card-header">It’s Creative</h2>
            <p className="why-card-text">
              With hard money, you can get funding on great deals that banks
              would normally shun. Promising investment properties that needs
              repairs, make them unsuitable for most banks, but perfect for most
              hard money lenders.
            </p>

          <div className="why-card">
            <h2 className="why-card-header">It’s Flexible</h2>
            <p className="why-card-text">
              Hard money lenders don’t have the same strictly-enforced
              guidelines to follow for their loan applications, so they are more
              willing to help creatively structure loans that work for the
              project.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p className="why-text">
          Partnering with a Hard Money Lender, like Quadruple J. Capital, gives
          you confidence to put properties under contract. Remember, when you
          find the deal that fits our guidelines, do the proper due-diligence,
          and turn in an application, you can be assured that the deal will be
          funded!
